# hands-on-lab-neo4j-and-sagemaker
Neo4j is the [leading graph database](https://neo4j.com/whitepapers/forrester-wave-graph-data-platforms/) vendor.  We’ve worked closely with AWS Engineering for years.  Our products, Neo4j Graph Database, Graph Data Science and Bloom are offered in the AWS Marketplace.

We’re planning a series of hands on labs with AWS architects and their customer.  The goal of these workshops is to give a better understanding of how to identify use cases for Neo4j.  These sessions aren’t intended to make attendees experts in Neo4j.  Instead, the idea is to give them a good foundation to understand when to when to work with Neo4j.

## Venue
These workshops are organized onsite in an AWS office.

## Duration
3 hours.
