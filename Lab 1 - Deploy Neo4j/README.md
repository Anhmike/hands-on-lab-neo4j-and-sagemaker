# Lab 1 - Deploy Neo4j
In this lab, we're going to deploy Neo4j Enterprise Edition from the AWS Marketplace.  That listing has a Cloud Formation template under it that we'll inspect.  We'll also look at more customizable deployment options.

## Sign up for AWS
The most basic thing you're going to need for these labs is an AWS account.  If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up for one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

You'll need to provide your phone number and credit card information.  Total costs for the lab should be significantly under $50.  At the end of the lab we'll show you how to delete any resources you've deployed as well.

## Apply AWS Credits
As part of the labs, AWS is providing credits.  The credits should far exceed the cost of resources consumed during this lab.  You can apply the credits to your account by navigating [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/credits)

## Pick a Region
For this lab, you'll want to pick one AWS region to put all your resources in.  It doesn't particularly matter which region you use.  That said, if you use the default region for your account, things will probably be simpler.  You can tell which region is selected by looking in the upper right of the AWS console [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).  In the image below, the region is N. Virginia, also known as us-east-1.

Whatever region you select, make sure that you're logged into it as you proceed through the following steps.

## Create a Key Pair
The machine we're going to create for the lab will be an EC2 instance.  We'll need to create a key pair to connect to the instance.
