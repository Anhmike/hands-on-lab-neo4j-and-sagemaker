# Lab 4 - Exploring Data
In this lab, we're going to use Bloom to explore our data set a bit.  Bloom is Neo4j's business intelligence (BI) tool.

## Vizualization with Neo4j Bloom
You can open Bloom as we did in Lab 2.  When open Bloom, you should see the login screen.  Use the same credentials we used before.

That should take you to the home screen.  Click in the search bar and then click on "Manager."

If the search bar doesn't populate, you may have to click in the upper left and add the three entities: "Manager", "Holding", and "Company".

Then click on the link for manager-holding.

Then click on the link to add manager-holding-company.

And now hit enter to run the query.

That will give you a view with many nodes.

Now, spend a bit of time exploring the graph.  You can zoom in by holding on the "+" icon.  You can also drag the canvas around to choose what you zoom in on.

This is only a tiny bit of what Bloom can do.  Feel free to explore!
