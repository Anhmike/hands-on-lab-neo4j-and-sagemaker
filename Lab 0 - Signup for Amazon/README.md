The most basic thing you're going to need for these labs is an AWS account.  If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up for one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

You'll need to provide your phone number and credit card information.  Total costs for the lab should be significantly under $50.  At the end of the lab we'll show you how to delete any resources you've deployed as well.
